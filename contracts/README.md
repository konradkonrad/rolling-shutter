This directory contains an example hardhat project [1]. Eventually
rolling shutter's smart contracts will live here.

Run

```
npx hardhat test
```

to run the tests on normal Ethereum.

Run

```
npx hardhat --network optimistic test
```

to test on Optimistic Ethereum. This assumes you are running a local Optimistic Ethereum network.

[1] setup according to https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-tutorial/tree/main/hardhat
